# A build profile specifies your project's environment
# and the association of namespaces to HML files
# You can create different build profiles for different environments,
# like production and staging, which may reference environment-specific auth configs.
# We have created one for you to get you started
buildProfiles:
  - build-profile.yaml

# This refers to the default build profile
# that is used when you create a build and
# don't specify which build profile to use.
