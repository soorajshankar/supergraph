  # Namespaces can be used to group certain objects of your metadata
  # in a way that makes sense for you and your team.
  # You can have multiple HML files belong to a namespace
  # and you can have multiple namespaces in a project.
  # We have created a `default` namespace for you, and added an HML file to it to get you started
  # Please note that `default` is a special namespace that is created for every project
  # and it CANNOT be deleted.
